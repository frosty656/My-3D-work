# My-3D-work
### I am always looking to simplify things in my life and 3D designing and printing helps me do this. Here are just some of the things that I have made to make my life a little easier.

## Wire Rack Wine Glass Holder
### This was made where the hooks will snap onto the wire rack and the strip below will allow wine glasses to slide in and hang.

## Under Desk Power Strip Holder
### This screws into the bottom of a desk and holds a power strip there for better looking power supply

## Tool Holder
### This holds the tools and attachments I use most often so they are always out on the desk but still have a place to call home

## Under Desk Laptop Holder
### This can hold two laptops flush agaisnt the bottom of the desk so they do not take up any space when using external monitors.

## Under Desk Cable Management
### This screws into the desk and allows a large amount of cables to be held in place. Great if you do not like to look at cables.

## Lamp Attachment
### This was a mod for my Ender 3. It allows an Ikea lamp to be directly attached to the printer so the print is always lit up.

## Headphone Cable Holder
### This can keep the headphone cables organized under your desk and not have them move around

## Dishwasher Indicator
### Sometimes you just cannot remeber when the dishwasher has clean or dirty dishes and you don't want to mix them.

## Custom Mirror Hanger
### This is to hold a mirror that is usually used as on a table onto a wall
