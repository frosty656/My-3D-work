# My-3D-work
### I am always looking to simplify things in my life and 3D designing and printing helps me do this. Here are just some of the things that I have made to make my life a little easier.

## Wire Rack Wine Glass Holder
### This was made where the hooks will snap onto the wire rack and the strip below will allow wine glasses to slide in and hang.
